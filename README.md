Economic Growth Analysis of Countries with and without Nuclear Weapons

This project analyzes and compares the economic growth rates of countries with and without nuclear weapons. The analysis includes statistical tests and visualizations to understand the relationship between the presence of nuclear weapons and economic growth rates.
